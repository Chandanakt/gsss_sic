Arithmetic operators:
+, *, /,//, %, -

binary numbers= 0,1
octal numbers+ 0-7
hexadecimal number= 0-15

signed and unsigned numbers have different values in binary

NOTE: 5 + 6.055 (this can't solved directly because floating point numbers are stored differently according to IEEE standards)

Relational operators
<,>,<=,>=,!=,==
i/p is numbers
o/p is boolean
have higher precedence than logical operators but lesser than arithmetic operators
 
intervals:
 [10,20]  closed intervals
 (10,20)  open intervals

Logical operators:
 and, or, not (python)
 &, &&, ||, |, ! (c,c++,java,c#)

 i/p and o/p both are boolean
 right to left associativity
